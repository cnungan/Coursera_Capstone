    "In the final project of IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate course, I will analyze the neighborhoods in New York City and form clusters. The aim of the project is to explore further the underlying patterns in Manhattan neighborhoods by the help of machine learning techniques, more specifically k-means clustering. This project might be of use to city planners, business owners or anyone who'd like to have an in depth understanding about the neighborhoods in a  given city. In every city we sense certain ways of groupings such as residential, industrial and maybe more commercially concentrated areas. Unless these neighborhoods are named after their purpose, it might be hard to understand the nature of them. For deliberately planned cities - like NYC - it is relatively easier to know on our own and also to cluster the neighborhoods. Therefore, the scope of this project was suitable for beginner level clustering and enabled ease of interpretation of the outcomes. "

    "#### Data Collection, Understanding and Preparation \n",
    "One of the most important and the most troublesome phase of th project was the data collection. Many resources are not publicly available which makes the precision of the analysis more difficult to achieve. Yet devoting, time and effort to this phase taught me to be patient and thorough with finding, cleaning and preparing the data for the analysis. Although having learned in theory that this part takes the most time compared to the other parts of the project, now I practically experienced that I should not expect this process to be smooth and fast. In fact, taking time on this phase made the following sections easier to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used three sources of data. First, I constructed a table by scraping data from city-data.com and areavibes.com. Consisting information of Median Household Income (city-data) and Crime Rate (areavibes) belonging to the 40 neighborhoods in the Manhattan borough, the data was of the year 2017. Second dataset was a json file which I reached via Coursera that consists each neighborhood's latitude and longitude values. Third, I used Foursquare API by creating a developer account to get the government buildings in each neighborhood. With all these data at hand, I tried to find correlations and hidden patterns among median income, crime rate and the number of government buildings."

    "#### Methodology \n",
    "After creating a map of Manhattan, NYC and using Foursquare API to get the venues in the 'Government Building' category in each neighborhood, we can proceed to the analytics and visualization phase. \n",
    "Since one of the attributes of the clustering dataset will be the number of government buildings in each neighborhood, I will create another data frame in which the frequency is shown and plot the graph for it. To explore our data, using *.describe()* I extracted the mean, standard deviation, upper and lower quartiles, median, minimum and maximum values for each attribute in our data frame. Then, to test for the strength of the association between the variables, I used correlation and checked the coefficient and the p-value to see if the relation was significant. Turns out, number of government buildings and the median household income in the neighborhood have a moderate but statistically significant correlation with the coefficient of 0.56 and a p-value of 0.0001. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I will start clustering the neighborhoods as the main objective of this project is to identify relationships. As I stated earlier, the project aims to reveal relationships among the observations that was perhaps not possible to with the individual observations. It also simplifies the data by viewing each observation (neighborhoods) as a member of a cluster and profiling them according to their general characteristics. The overall goal of the project requires clustering and more specifically non-hierarchical k-means algorithm. To interpret features with different magnitudes and distributions equally, I will normalize the values in my main data frame to proceed with a better clustering. Additionally, to determine the best number of clusters to form, I will check the distortion for each value of k from 1 to 10. Then performing the k-means, I come up with the clustered neighborhoods and look for the characteristics and discuss them in the result section.  "

    "#### Discussion  \n",
    "The cluster analysis of Manhattan Neighborhoods were successful in profiling the neighborhoods according to the features of Median Household Income, Crime Rate per 1000 people and Number of Government Buildings. The clusters represent quite different characteristics of neighborhoods, varying in observations for each feature. Commenting on each cluster was easier due to the evident difference in characteristics in clustered neighborhoods. \n",
    "I would like to suggest three issues about the whole process. First, the analysis can be performed with four clusters to compare the results and determine the better clustering of neighborhoods. Further steps can include evaluating the practical significance of both instances. Second, during the analysis, I had another idea of clustering: Could the types (rather than the number) of government buildings be a better attribute to build the clusters? The existence of different government building types such as police precinct, embassy, city hall ... etc. might have different relations with the crime rate or median household income. Third, although the variable 'crime rate per 1000 people' represented the overall crime in a neighborhood, more specific crimes might have reflected a better picture about neighborhood crime data. Homicide rates, specifically, are considered to be better indicator, however, the data was not available.     "

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "In this study, I clustered 40 neighborhoods of Manhattan NYC according to their median household income, crime rates, and number of government buildings. A lot of other indicators of neighborhood characteristics such as school ratings or other demographic data might be included for a further study. Neighborhoods and cities change, they are like living organisms that evolve with generations of humankind. They also have many characteristics that may or may not be discovered by data. I'd like to conclude with a quote from Hans Rösling from his book 'Factlulness': 'The world cannot be understood without numbers. But the world cannot be understood with numbers alone.' As an aspiring analyst, I see this project as an important accomplishment, for it was my introduction to a whole new world of Data Science."
